##  Features

-  **Text & File Encryption**
  - Encrypts text and files using a custom shifting key algorithm.
  - Key evolves per character to strengthen encryption.

-  **User Login & Registration**
  - Secure login system with password hashing.
  - Uses bcrypt for hashing and salting passwords to prevent brute-force and rainbow table attacks.

-  **Digital Signature Verification (RSA)**
  - Verifies message authenticity and integrity.
  - Generates RSA key pair (private/public) for signing and verification.
  - Ensures decryption is only allowed after successful signature verification.

-  **Data Integrity Check (SHA-256)**
  - Hashes data before signing using SHA-256.
  - Even small changes result in a different hash, ensuring data wasn‚Äôt tampered.

-  **Educational Focus**
  - Demonstrates real-world cryptographic concepts.
  - Ideal for students or beginners learning about encryption, hashing, digital signatures, and secure GUI design.
